This section, the IHE IT Infrastructure (ITI) Analysis of Optimal De-Identification for Family Planning Data Elements, demonstrates the application of the IHE De-Identification Handbook's systematic process framework. It describes the comprehensive de-identification analysis performed by the ITI Technical Committee for the Family Planning Annual Report (FPAR) use case published in the IHE Quality, Research, and Public Health (QRPH) Family Planning version 2 (FPv2) Trial Implementation Supplement, Rev. 1.4 (December 29, 2021).

### Purpose and Overview

This document serves as a practical demonstration of the de-identification process framework detailed in the [De-Identification Process](process.html) chapter. It follows the systematic, multi-stage approach that balances privacy protection with data utility for public health reporting.

The FPAR de-identification analysis demonstrates:

1.  **Context Analysis**: Clearly defining the data collection purpose, recipients, and data flow within the Title X family planning service network
2.  **Data Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation of data content, including attribute classification using the updated [Data Types](data-types.html) framework (Direct Identifiers, Quasi-Identifiers, Sensitive Attributes)
3.  **Goal Determination**: Establishing specific de-identification objectives that balance clinical and privacy perspectives
4.  **Risk Assessment**: Both qualitative and quantitative evaluation of re-identification risks
5.  **Risk Mitigation Design**: Multi-stage de-identification architecture with element-by-element algorithm selection using techniques from the [Algorithms](algorithms.html) chapter
6.  **Implementation and Validation**: Process validation and governance framework
7.  **Identifiability Transitions**: Demonstrating the transformation from Identified Data through Reversible-Pseudonymized Data to achieve the target identifiability level as defined in [Concepts](concepts.html#Identifiability)

The detailed design questions that guide algorithm selection are organized by attribute type in the **Project and Data Details** subsection under **De-identification Goals**.

## Intended Audience

This implementation guide serves three primary audiences:

1.  **Software Developers and Implementers**: Those who will implement the de-identification algorithms into their software systems. This audience should use the IHE QRPH Family Planning version 2 (FPv2) supplement for technical specifications, referring to this document for the rationale behind design decisions. Familiarity with the [Algorithms](algorithms.html) chapter is recommended.

2.  **Privacy and Security Professionals**: Those responsible for designing, validating, and governing de-identification processes. This document demonstrates the application of the systematic [Process](process.html) framework, including context analysis, risk assessment, and mitigation design. It serves as a template for other de-identification projects.

3.  **Clinicians, Researchers, and Data Analysts**: Those who seek to understand how and why specific de-identification algorithms were selected for each data element, and how the resulting dataset maintains utility for public health reporting while protecting patient privacy. This audience will benefit from understanding the [Data Types](data-types.html) classification and the [Concepts](concepts.html#Identifiability) of identifiability levels.

## Context Analysis

This section analyzes the environment in which Family Planning data is collected, processed, and shared, following the framework established in the [Process](process.html) chapter.

### Purpose of Data Collection

The intended use of the de-identified data determines the extent of de-identification and acceptable risk levels. The primary purpose for collecting Family Planning data is:

**Primary Purpose**: To support the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (OPA) Title X Family Planning Annual Reports (FPAR) for:
-   Program planning and budgeting at federal and grantee levels
-   Basic monitoring of program performance and adherence to funded project scope
-   Clinical quality improvement initiatives
-   Ensuring clients receive access to a broad range of family planning services and methods
-   Verifying services are delivered to intended populations
-   Budget justification to Congress for family planning service funding
-   Allocation of funding to address unmet needs in specific geographic areas

**Scope Constraints**: The de-identified dataset is specifically designed for public health reporting and program evaluation. It is *not* intended to support:
-   General-purpose research requiring high-fidelity individual-level data
-   Clinical treatment or patient care (data has already been used for that purpose)
-   Re-identification for adverse event notification (not applicable to this non-interventional use case)

### Data Recipients

The de-identified FPAR data will be accessed by the following categories of recipients:

**Organizational Recipients**:
-   OPA headquarters staff (federal employees)
-   Title X grantees (approximately 89 organizations)
-   Sub-recipient agencies under Title X grantees
-   Service sites within the Title X network (approximately 4,100 sites)

**Recipient Profiles**:
-   Public health professionals and program managers responsible for Title X program oversight
-   Data analysts conducting performance measurement and quality improvement
-   Grant administrators monitoring compliance and resource allocation

**Relationship to Data Custodian**: The data flows from service sites to sub-recipients to grantees to OPA, creating a hierarchical reporting structure. All recipients operate under Title X grant agreements with confidentiality obligations.

**Background Knowledge Assessment**: Recipients have varying levels of background knowledge:
-   High knowledge: Service site staff may know individual patients in their local community
-   Medium knowledge: Grantee-level staff may have regional demographic knowledge
-   Lower knowledge: OPA headquarters staff have limited local community knowledge
-   External risk: With potential access numbering in the thousands, the risk posture requires treating this as a controlled-public sharing model rather than fully internal use

### Data Flow

The de-identification architecture for Family Planning data follows a centralized model to ensure consistency and apply specialized expertise:

**Original Data Source**: Family Planning CDA documents generated at approximately 4,100 service sites that provide family planning and related preventive health services

**De-identification Architecture**: Based on public comment feedback, a single, centralized de-identification intermediary was selected over multiple distributed de-identification points. This decision was driven by:
-   Need for consistent pseudonymization across all sources
-   Requirement for specialized expertise in privacy-preserving transformations
-   Maintaining accuracy and longitudinal consistency
-   Centralized application of risk assessment methodologies

**Data Transformation Process**: The de-identification process transforms Family Planning CDA documents (identified data) into de-identified CSV format suitable for FPAR reporting:

1.  **Input**: Family Planning CDA documents from 4,100 service sites (Identified Data per [Concepts](concepts.html#Identifiability))
2.  **Stage 1 - Preliminary De-identification**: At source or early in pipeline, basic transformations remove direct identifiers and apply reversible pseudonymization
3.  **Stage 2 - Advanced De-identification**: Centralized intermediary applies:
    -   Irreversible pseudonymization for patient identifiers
    -   Generalization for quasi-identifiers (dates, geographic data)
    -   Suppression for unnecessary direct identifiers
    -   Risk assessment and validation
4.  **Output**: De-identified CSV file where each row represents a de-identified Family Planning visit
5.  **Distribution**: To OPA and authorized Title X network recipients

**Data Flow Diagram**: The complete data flow in the Title X FPAR use case is illustrated in the figure below. The diagram reflects a multi-stage de-identification process, where Family Planning CDA documents move from service sites through preliminary de-identification (Stage 1), then through a centralized advanced de-identification intermediary (Stage 2), before reaching final recipients. Each stage applies distinct privacy-preserving transformations, as described in the text above.

This diagram illustrates the two-stage de-identification architecture: Stage 1 (Preliminary De-identification) occurs at the source or early in the pipeline, and Stage 2 (Advanced De-identification) is performed by a centralized intermediary. Data flows and process points in the diagram correspond to these stages, showing how privacy risk is progressively reduced before data reaches authorized recipients.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

**Important Note**: All data flows indicate submission of Family Planning CDA documents only. Other document types that may be submitted by the same participants through similar workflows are out of scope for this analysis.

### Regulatory and Policy Context

**Applicable Regulations**:
-   HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164)
-   Title X of the Public Health Service Act
-   Federal grant requirements for OPA Title X program

**Data Sensitivity**: Family Planning data involves sensitive reproductive health information requiring enhanced privacy protection for a potentially vulnerable patient population.

## Data Assessment

This section provides a comprehensive evaluation of the Family Planning data following the assessment framework in the [Process](process.html) chapter.

### Data Subject Characteristics

**Population**: Individuals receiving family planning services at Title X-funded clinics

**Key Characteristics**:
-   **Age Range**: Predominantly reproductive age (15-44 years), including adolescents and older individuals
-   **Geographic Distribution**: Nationwide across U.S. states and territories, concentrated in underserved areas
-   **Gender**: Predominantly female patients, with male patients also served
-   **Socioeconomic Status**: Primarily low-income (Title X targets ≤250% federal poverty level)
-   **Vulnerable Population Status**: Enhanced re-identification risks due to potential social stigma, concentrated service delivery, and overlapping demographic characteristics

### Data Type and Content

**Structured Data** (Primary format): Family Planning CDA documents containing:
-   Demographics: age, gender, race, ethnicity, language
-   Socioeconomic: income, health insurance status
-   Clinical: pregnancy history, services provided
-   Identifiers: patient, provider, facility IDs
-   Temporal: dates of birth, visit dates
-   Geographic: ZIP codes, facility locations

**Free Text**: Limited presence; requires NLP-based identifier scrubbing

**Format**: CDA/XML requiring XML parsing capabilities for de-identification processing

### Data Attribute Classification

Following the [Data Types](data-types.html) framework:

**Direct Identifiers**: Patient Name (excluded from FPAR), Facility Name (transformed to ID), Provider Name (transformed to ID)

**Quasi-Identifiers**: Date of Birth/Age, Visit Date, Sex, Race, Ethnicity, ZIP Code, Language, Pregnancy History, Income, Insurance Status

**Sensitive Attributes**: Services Received, Clinical Procedures, Pregnancy Outcomes, STI Test Results

### Dataset Properties

-   **Currency**: Operational data; annual FPAR compilation
-   **Scale**: ~3.9 million patients annually from 4,100 service sites
-   **Quality**: High-quality structured data with standard terminologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD, CDC PHIN VADS)
-   **Longitudinal Characteristic**: Multiple visits per patient increase re-identification risk

### Attack Modeling

**Sharing Model**: Controlled Public Sharing (Data Use Agreement)
-   Accessible to thousands of authorized Title X participants
-   Federal grant agreements prohibit re-identification
-   Risk level: Moderate-to-high protection required

**Attack Types**: Identity attacks (journalist risk), attribute attacks on small groups, membership attacks

**Privacy Model**: k-anonymity (provides measurable, interpretable guarantees for quasi-identifier linkage attacks)

### Terminology Reference

This analysis uses core terminology defined in the [Concepts](concepts.html) chapter, including de-identification, pseudonymization, anonymization, and identifiability levels. For complete definitions, refer to that chapter.

**Domain-Specific Terms**:

-   **PHIN VADS**: Public Health Information Network Vocabulary Access and Distribution System from CDC (<https://phinvads.cdc.gov/vads/SearchVocab.action>) - standard code sets for demographics
-   **FPAR**: Family Planning Annual Report required for Title X program
-   **Title X**: Federal grant program (Public Health Service Act) for family planning services
## De-identification Goals

This section establishes specific objectives for the FPAR de-identification process per the [Process](process.html) framework, balancing privacy protection with data utility.

### General Goals

1.  **Prevent Identification**: Remove/transform direct identifiers; reduce combinability of quasi-identifiers
2.  **Control Risk**: Achieve acceptable residual risk for controlled-public sharing
3.  **Preserve Utility**: Maintain fidelity for FPAR reporting, performance measurement, trend analysis, and geographic analysis

### Specific FPAR Goals

**Scope**: U.S. Title X context; reporting purpose only (NOT general research); protects vulnerable reproductive health patients

**Entity De-identification**: Patients (primary), facilities and providers (secondary, to prevent indirect identification)

**Data Fidelity**: Maintain aggregate accuracy, preserve longitudinal relationships, support geographic analysis

**Identifiability Target**: **Irreversibly Pseudonymized Data** ([Concepts](concepts.html#Identifiability)) - stronger than reversible pseudonymization, practical for longitudinal utility

**Risk Threshold**: Average re-identification risk ≤ 0.05 (5%); k-anonymity with k ≥ 20 as working target

**Rationale**: Non-public controlled sharing + medium-high attack possibility + medium-high impact (sensitive data, vulnerable population) = conservative threshold needed

### Project and Data Details (attribute-specific design questions)

To select algorithms per element, the following questions are applied by attribute type:

**Direct Identifiers (DI)**
-   Can it be deleted entirely?
-   If retained, can it be pseudonymized (reversible or irreversible)?

**Categorical Quasi-Identifiers (QI)** (e.g., race, ethnicity, language, insurance)
-   Can the value be generalized or grouped (e.g., broader categories)?
-   Can rare categories be suppressed or recoded?
-   Is code substitution acceptable (meaningful vs. meaningless)?

**Numerical Quasi-Identifiers (QI)** (e.g., income, counts)
-   Can the value be truncated, rounded, top/bottom coded, or statistically adjusted?
-   Can outliers be replaced with floor/ceiling values?

**Temporal Quasi-Identifiers** (e.g., DOB, visit date, time of day)
-   Can dates be collapsed (e.g., to month/year) or shifted by random offset?
-   Can time of day be generalized (e.g., weekend/weekday)?
-   Must longitudinal consistency be maintained after transformation?

**Geographic Quasi-Identifiers** (e.g., ZIP, facility location)
-   Can geography be generalized (e.g., 3-digit ZIP, county/region)?
-   Must longitudinal/geographic consistency be maintained across records?

**Free Text / Sensitive Attributes**
-   Can free text be removed or NLP-scrubbed? Can attributes be made fuzzier (noise/random code set)?
-   Can values be substituted with pseudorandom or sequential recoverable values when utility requires?

**Iterative Review**
-   After initial selections, perform holistic review to ensure transformations reduce risk without over-suppressing utility; document usability and threat analyses.

### Balancing Clinical and Privacy Perspectives

**Clinical/Public Health**: Maintain FPAR performance measures, analytical utility for program evaluation

**Privacy/Security**: Protect vulnerable patients, minimize combinable quasi-identifiers, account for thousands of potential recipients

### Use Cases from FPv2 Supplement

OPA requires the collection of family planning service delivery data in the form of the FPAR as a condition of its grant awards. The office uses the data for program planning and budgeting, monitoring program performance, clinical quality improvement, budget justification to Congress, and allocation of funding to address unmet need for family planning services in specific areas of the U.S. and its territories.

The IHE QRPH Family Planning version 2 (FPv2) supplement defines five use cases for family planning data collection and reporting:

1.  **Use Case #1: FP Manual Data Entry** - Manual data entry into family planning forms at service sites
2.  **Use Case #2: FP with Pre-pop Option** - Forms pre-populated with existing patient data from clinical systems
3.  **Use Case #3: FP with Pre-pop Option with Supplemental Data** - Pre-populated forms supplemented with additional clinical data sources
4.  **Use Case #4: Forms Data Capture with Document Submission** - Structured data capture with subsequent document submission
5.  **Use Case #5: EHR FP Document Submission** - Direct submission of family planning documents from EHR systems

All five use cases involve collection of family planning data from Title X grantees, sub-recipients, and service sites that provide a wide range of family planning and related preventive health services. The de-identification analysis in this document applies to all FPv2 use cases.

**Important Scope Limitation**: This analysis is specific to the Title X FPAR context in the United States. The conclusions regarding optimal de-identification algorithms relate exclusively to this use case. Organizations wishing to utilize these data elements in other programs must conduct their own de-identification analysis, considering local needs and applicable legislation.

The identified data described in the FPv2 supplement is used for clinical purposes at the point of care. A
de-identified data set is needed for reporting and performance
measurement purposes. The de-identified data set is **not** intended to be suitable for general research purposes, as that would result in too broad and identifiable a data set. Data
elements that may be useful for some research purposes may
be redacted or segregated into separate reports to reduce
risk to vulnerable patients.

For purposes of risk analysis and exposure of the de-identified data
set, our assumptions include:

-   Data is collected by the up to 4,100 service sites that comprise the
    Title X network

-   Data is de-identified by a single, central de-identification third
    party

-   Data is submitted in a de-identified manner to OPA

-   De-identified data is made available to authorized staff from OPA
    headquarters and staff from OPA’s family planning service grantees
    and their subrecipient agencies

The risk posture of this data set is not the same as making the data
publicly available; however, with potential access numbering in the
thousands, securing this data set is a significant challenge that
must be considered during the de-identification process.

**Architectural Context**: Since the FPAR data will have already been used to provide treatment and services to the patient at the point of care, the de-identified data is not needed for clinical purposes. The de-identified data supports program evaluation, performance measurement, and policy decisions for the Title X network.

From an architectural perspective, the FPAR use case depends on
de-identification being performed prior to submission to the host
organization. This means de-identification could be conducted by a third
party intermediary performed at the source EHR. However, multiple points
and levels of de-identification pose a risk to the accuracy and
longitudinal consistency of the data and therefore after public comment
feedback a single, centralized de-identification third party
architecture was agreed upon.

## Element-by-Element De-identification Analysis

This section provides detailed rationale for the de-identification technique selected for each Family Planning data element, demonstrating the practical application of the systematic framework established in previous sections.

### Analysis Methodology

Each element analysis follows a structured approach integrating concepts from the updated handbook:

1.  **Data Type Classification**: Classifying the element per the [Data Types](data-types.html) framework (Direct Identifier, Quasi-Identifier, Sensitive Attribute, or Non-Identifier)

2.  **Utility Assessment**: Evaluating the element's necessity for FPAR reporting and performance measurement (per De-identification Goals)

3.  **Technique Selection**: Choosing appropriate techniques from the [Algorithms](algorithms.html) catalog:
    -   Suppression techniques (masking, local suppression)
    -   Pseudonymization techniques (irreversible hashing)
    -   Generalization techniques (rounding, top/bottom coding, truncation)

4.  **Longitudinal Consistency**: Determining if consistent values across multiple visits are required

5.  **Risk Contribution**: Assessing how the element contributes to re-identification risk (particularly for quasi-identifiers)

6.  **Threat Analysis**: Considering specific attack scenarios and background knowledge that could enable re-identification

7.  **Usability Validation**: Confirming the transformed element maintains sufficient utility for intended purposes

The following subsections analyze each data element in the IHE QRPH Family Planning Profile. For each element, the analysis documents the decision process leading to the selected technique, balancing the clinical/analytical requirements against privacy protection needs.

### Data Element Analyses

#### Facility identifier

**Data Type Classification**: Direct Identifier / Quasi-Identifier (transforms to QI after pseudonymization)

**Utility Assessment**: From a health services research perspective, the facility identifier is needed, at a minimum, to compare services or outcomes at the level of a small geographic region such as a county or township. When measuring
outcomes or service provision, it may also be beneficial to compare
different sites. Additionally, data contributors consuming this
de-identified data set for their own planning purposes would need some
way to distinguish outcomes or services provided across facilities. Some
form of longitudinal consistency is needed for these purposes, so this
data element cannot be deleted, and cannot be null.

The De-Identification spreadsheet[^5] that accompanied the
De-Identification whitepaper[^6], identifies each data element as being
of a particular kind of direct or indirect identifier, and indicates the
most important questions that need to be answered from the list of
de-identification methods in Section 1.1 above for that data type. These
individual question and answer pairs are left in for this data element,
to illustrate the decision process, but will be included in the
narrative in subsequent sections.

The Facility identifier is identified as being closest to either a
Person Name or Address. As such, the questions that must be answered in
order to determine de-identification requirements are:

-   Does this data element require longitudinal consistency to be
    maintained after de-identification?

Yes. For example, in order to stratify performance measures and service
delivery by facility in order to monitor variations in quality efforts
and patient outcomes.

-   Can it be deleted?

No, as noted above.

-   Can it be left in with no value?

No.

-   Can it contain a substitute value as a random number? (Fixed length
    or original length?)

Yes, as long as we identify a way to keep this value longitudinally
consistent.

-   Can the value be kept in escrow or provided by a third party and
    therefore segregated from the main data set?

Yes, but it may not be worth the cost of paying a third party for this
purpose and effort of keeping them up to date. However, since the
Clinical Provider ID, and Patient ID need to be pseudonymized using a
confidential mapping table, it makes sense to use the same approach for
Facility ID since we are doing it anyway.

-   Can the value be pseudonymized?[^7]

Yes. A pseudonymized set of facility identifiers is possible. The
pseudonyms must be: consistent, not shared with partners, etc.
Deployments can determine whether to use a mapping table, or assign
ownership of pseudonym updates.

-   Can the value be replaced by a sequential value that is recoverable?

No. This does not apply to this type of data.

-   Can it be generalized to a geographical location?

Maybe, depending on the purposes of the analysis. If geographic
reporting is good for the consumer of this data set, then this is an
acceptable technique.

It is important to note that in certain legal jurisdictions the legal
protection needed for the data changes once it has been de-identified.
These regulations are subject to change, so the de-identification
processes must be adaptable.

The answers to the above questions indicate that some form of pseudonymization is ideal for a
Facility Identifier due to the requirement for longitudinal consistency,
as well as the need to be able to group observations for a single
facility (cross-sectional consistency) and facility based analysis
(calculating measures at the facility level).

Types of pseudonymization optimal for Facility Identifier:

-   Use of a new mapping table created specifically for this purpose, or
    an existing mapping table such as the Title X or one maintained by
    the Guttmacher Institute. The risk inherent to this approach is
    keeping the existing table up to date.

-   Request facilities to manage their own anonymized/different facility
    ID known only to them at the time of submission and will be used for
    research submissions only.

-   Hashed identifiers.

As identified during the usability analysis of the de-Identified data
elements, it was determined that a mapping table is the preferred
approach to de-Identifying the Facility Identifier. This means that a
table will be maintained by an appointed organization, such as a
contracted third-party that contains all of the originating Facility
identifiers, as well as the list of de-identified values that they are
mapped to. For example:

| Facility ID of Origin | De-Identified Facility ID (Example only) |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 12678                 | 111-111                                  |
| 92457                 | 222-222                                  |
| 92774                 | 333-333                                  |
| 92837                 | 999-999                                  |
|                       | 777-777                                  |
{:.grid}

Identifier mapping should be generated using a standardized technique,
using a cryptographically strong randomly assigned identifier.

#### Clinical Provider identifier

Uses of this data element differ across different countries. In the
U.S., consumers of the de-identified data set may want to track outcomes
down to the provider level. For example, to identify providers who
screen for chlamydia among populations who don’t need it. In the U.S.,
this tracking is permitted by law. However, in Europe this may be viewed
as tracking individual employees without predetermined cause.

This data element could be deleted or left with no value, though the
cost of deleting this data element is removing granularity of the data
at the individual level. Some countries in Europe would actually mandate
the redaction of the level of reporting, and require that a problem be
identified at the facility level before being considered to have
sufficient cause to monitor at an individual level.

It is possible to pseudonymize this data element as well, especially
since a linked provider ID is rarely needed outside of the facility. The
National Provider Identifier (NPI) used in the U.S. is tied to practice
level and practice specialty and it may be possible to convert the
provider ID to the practice level and only use that, provided that
individual level analysis is not needed.

Anonymized data could come in as anonymized, but with a known mapping
table that is heavily protected. Management of this table could be
defined in governance for a given project. Governance could state that
in the U.S. Title X grantees can have access to the mapping table and
compare performance measures by providers, but that OPA has no need to
do so. Given this, the preferred approach is a mapping table; however,
the determination of where this mapping occurs, prior to submission to
OPA, is a critical component.

#### Patient identifier

The Patient identifier is needed in the de-identified family planning
data set to track longitudinal consistency of the data. In other words,
longitudinal consistency is when data is tracked over time and linked to
each patient over that period of time even though the patient itself is
not known. As a result, in order to achieve longitudinal consistency, a
de-identified patient identifier is needed to link individual records to
a unique, but unknown, patient. For family planning performance
measures, some form of a patient identifier is needed to track things
including changes in health and care status for a given patient.

As another example, if a yearly report includes data on 10,000 patient
visits conducted, without longitudinal consistency it will be impossible
to tell if that is 10,000 unique patients with one visit each or 2,000
patients with different visit frequencies.

When implementing, it is important to consider the tolerance for errors
in longitudinal consistency. For example: A very tight/low tolerance may
require a centralized authority to create tight pseudonyms and maintain
them. If you have a higher tolerance, you may be able to leverage a
hashed/random technique for pseudonymization.

Higher tolerance may be possible in this use case. Substitution would provide some level of pseudonymization provided the
technique is strong enough. E.g., “Use a random number generator to
replace the ID with a random ID number”. The issues with this approach
are that the random number generation needs to be sufficiently random,
AND loss of the mapping table makes re-identification and longitudinal
consistency impossible.

The value could be kept in escrow or provided by a third party and
therefore segregated from the main data set, and this may be the ideal
method under certain circumstances. However, there are possible
drawbacks. A key flaw is that it provides a single point of failure.
Also, access control and security safeguards for the escrow system must
be rigorous and workflow and policy around the third party escrow usage
are challenging to implement. (i.e., changing sites, sites may not
request pseudonyms in a timely manner, etc.)

This is a value that could be pseudonymized, and a potential
de-identification technique is to agree on a hashing technique. For example,
identify the Patient ID as a value that must be included in a hashed
section of the document, and agree on how the Patient IDs will be
represented so that the hashed values will always be interpreted in the
same way. A flaw with this technique is that it is vulnerable to a brute
force attack.

Another possible technique of pseudonymization is to use two-stage
pseudonymization. For example, assign a block of pseudonyms to the site,
and then download the responsibility to the site to manage
pseudonymization for their own internal patient IDs. Currently,
site-specific IDs are difficult to track, so this technique does not
significantly impact the quality of the data. A potential issue is the
technique may not be consistently applied and would be difficult to manage.

A third possibility is the use of a one-time key generator be used. The
typical technique is to identify a short data block, like the name of
the clinic and a sequence number and then encrypt it with AES. The key
secrecy is not that critical, but you can use the encrypted result as a
unique patient ID.

This analysis indicates that, assuming workflow, policy and access
control safeguards make escrow an impractical solution, one-way
pseudonymization technique may be optimal; however, the requirement
for implementations to specify the retention duration of the local
mapping table must be made clear.

Identifier mapping should be generated using a standardized algorithm,
using a cryptographically strong randomly assigned identifier.

#### Visit Date

The visit date is used to measure trends, intervals between visits,
intervals between assessment of pregnancy intention and positive
pregnancy test results, etc. As multiple clinic visits by the same
patient on the same day are unlikely to occur, time of day is not a
required level of detail and must be removed. However, age at time of
visit should be calculated before this data element is de-identified.

One approach is to generalized the visit date to week of year values
(e.g., week 1, week 2, week 3). There are situations where patients come
in more than once a week, but it may be just as useful to say “3 times
in week 1” as the interval between days in that week may not be a
necessary detail. As a result of feedback submitted during public
comment, an indicator of visit order per week of year was added. Visit
dates shall henceforth be de-identified using a yearWweek-visitsequence
format, where:

-   "year" is the 4 digit year of the visit (e.g., 2014)

-   "Wweek" is the two digit week within the year (W05 for the fifth
    week; W52 for the last week)

-   "-A" is the visit order within the week (A = 1st visit of the week,
    B = 2nd visit of the week)

> For example, the 2<sup>nd</sup> visit of the fifth week of 2014 would
> be formatted as: 2014W05-B.

If we want to measure if a referral loop was completed within a 90-day
window, then any adjustment would need to be made identically to all
associated dates. For example, “add 5 days for all days for patient X,
and add 3 days for all patients Y”. However, this is unlikely to be
executed correctly/consistently and could introduce a lot of risk and
error, as well as additional maintenance of mapping tables.

Another risk of the adjusting by days approach is with annual reporting
where there are annual goals for users and the dates slide outside the
reporting year, etc.

Our conclusion is that the time component must be omitted if present.
Dates must be generalized to week of year values.

Note 1: Measures that involve the calculation of days may be affected by
this technique. Reporting periods may need to be fuzzed +- one week to
account for this.

Note 2: For smaller service sites that have low volume weeks, using
weekly values may still be a high re-identification risk. Those sites
may want to consider alternate methods of de-identification or possibly
other methods of data submission provided they do not have a significant
impact on the overall data set.

Note 3: When other dates that are recorded, such as test dates or
referral dates match the visit date, those dates must be modified to
match the weekly value of the visit date.

#### Date of Birth

Date of birth is used in family planning to do cross-tabulation with
reproductive lifespan, reproductive lifecycle and to determine services
needed at certain ages.

The Date of Birth is needed to know how old the patient is, because
according to various clinical guidelines certain procedures must be
performed at certain ages, e.g., pap smears for women ages 21 and over.
On the performance measure side, report data is often grouped according
to age brackets for the population (for example, adolescents, adults
over 20, etc.).

Since the de-identified data set will not be used for clinical purposes,
the performance measure side mentioned above is the core focus here.

As per the De-Identification spreadsheet that accompanied the
De-Identification whitepaper, the Date of Birth is equivalent to the DOB
field. As such, the questions that must be answered in order to
determine de-identification requirements are:

Historically, the FPAR has collected age in “brackets.” Age brackets are
fairly specific and may need to be fairly granular at some levels. 10
year brackets may be a problem. 5 year intervals may be manageable
except at the edges. Age brackets may not be acceptable without a
standard pre-selected. In addition, for different measures, an
individual may fall into a different age bracket.

However, for certain performance measures, such as pap smears, the age
groups need to be quite granular. Brackets that are too broad can be a
problem due to guidelines changing frequently. If large groups were used
it would be impossible to assess if those guidelines are being followed.

When the Family Planning CDA document is produced, it will contain a
date of birth. If it is decided later on to calculate age at date of X
test, then the document will already contain an age, so it may be
possible to remove the DOB. However, date of the test for which age is
calculated may not be the same as age at the time of the document, so we
may end up having an age at the top of the document as well as
observation based ages.

Current recommendation is to calculate the age at date of visit and
submit that as a whole number (i.e., if the person is 18.6 at the time
of the visit, the age reported will be “18”. For clients over 50,
generalize their age to “over 50”.

#### Administrative Sex

Administrative Sex is not a clinical or genetic statement; it is used
for administrative purposes. Administrative Sex also does not equal
gender.

Administrative Sex is driven by the administrative categories that are
needed by the facility and the people they interact with.

This data element is needed to analyze care statistics for both females
and males. Both females and males are served in Family Planning.

Female numbers are used to measure contraceptive effectiveness.
Administrative sex is also needed as a primary demographic
characteristic as the users. Leaving this element in increases the risk
for the male individual since for example for Title X only 8% of the
population consuming family planning services is male, however there are
sufficient reasons to know number of males that the best method may be
to completely drop any encounter level data for patients that identify
as unknown.

The risk to that approach is that differences in numbers reported may
identify the number of unknowns at a given site; however, it is possible
to lose encounter level reports for other reasons so we need to
determine the likelihood of identifying unknown genders. As a result, a
two-step approach may be best, where the service site itself would:

-   Use a binary and ask individuals to pick “Female” or “Male” if they
    can; and

-   Redact entire encounter level data for patients that identify as
    “other” and do not submit that encounter at all.

After repeated discussion, the committee concluded that encounter
documents where the Administrative sex was listed as “other” that this
value should be changed to female for de-identification purposes. This
approach is the simplest and will not have a significant impact on
performance measures.

Please note that HL7<sup>®</sup>[^8] changed the name of “Administrative
Sex” to “Administrative Gender” in August 2012, which has caused some
confusion. The term used here is “Administrative Sex” because that is
what is currently used in the IHE QRPH Family Planning Profile.

#### Pregnancy History

Pregnancy History is a stratification variable that can have fertility
implications in the clinical realm. In the performance measurement
realm, this data element may not be necessary.

Number of pregnancies and number of births may be valuable information
to assist in understanding the population and to group women by parity
level. For the Title X FPAR use case, this data element
will not be collected at the national level. Organizations outside of Title X requiring this data element must conduct their own de-identification analysis considering their specific context and applicable regulations.

#### Limited Language Proficiency

The data element describes family planning users who do not speak the
national dominant language (e.g., English in the U.S.) as their primary
language and who have a limited ability to read, write, speak or
understand the dominant language and therefore require language
assistance services (interpretation or translation) in order to optimize
their use of health services.

CDA allows four different conceptualizations of language use:
understanding, speaking, reading, and writing.

Limited Language Proficiency is an important demographic descriptor. The
history behind this HHS requirement is to ensure that individuals with
limited local language proficiency have appropriate access to services.
This is a significant part of providing a safety net for individuals who
have barriers to care, but the granularity of language information that
can be described in CDA is not necessary for this purpose. The value set
can be limited.

However, data is collected in the local system; the only data that
should be submitted for performance measurement purposes is “LEP YES/LEP
NO”. All other language data should be redacted. Given that the data set
is a large population, people with a limited language proficiency in
English are still fairly numerous so the group of people affected by a
“YES” is not an extremely high risk of identifiability.

#### Ethnicity

Ethnicity is a stratification variable used in performance measurement
to track healthcare disparities by ethnicity. For example, in the U.S.
30% of Title X Family Planning users identify as Hispanic. Additionally,
in the U.S., this is an important health disparities measure as The
Department of Health and Human Services wants to make sure clients of
certain ethnicities are not being denied appropriate care.

In some countries, this data element must absolutely be preserved and,
in some countries, it must be removed. Deletion of this data element is
left up to discussion in national extensions. In the U.S., this data
element is mandatory for federal reporting.

It is possible to substitute ethnicity values with a less precise value
set. In the U.S., this value set has already been reduced to two very
broad categories of “Hispanic or Latino” or “Not Hispanic or Latino”.
However, this limited set does split the population down to 70% “Not”
versus 30% for clients who are Hispanic or Latino. There could
potentially be the addition of “Unknown”, which may not be needed given
that 30% is still a large population. In areas where there are very few
of either category, rules for cell suppression may be needed if the
number of people reported in any kind of analysis would be lower than a
pre-determined limit.

For the stated use case in the U.S., “Hispanic or Latino” and “Not
Hispanic or Latino” are sufficient. Note that current FPAR has three
categories; Hispanic/Latino, Not Hispanic/Not Latino, and Unknown.

#### Race

Race is used as a stratification variable to track healthcare
disparities by race. For example, in the U.S., 21% of Title X users in
2013 were Black or African American.

In some countries, this data element must absolutely be preserved, and
in other countries, it must be removed. Deletion of this data element is
left up to discussion in national extensions. In the U.S., this data
element is mandatory for federal reporting.

The data set can be generalized, using the 5 OMB categories. In the
U.S., it is possible to accept up to 900 categories, but at minimum, the
5 OMB categories are necessary for performance measurement. Currently
the categories are:

1002-5 American Indian or Alaska Native2028-9 Asian2054-5 Black or
African American2076-8 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander2106-3
White

In areas where there are very few of a given category, rules for cell
suppression may be needed if the number of people reported in any kind
of analysis would be lower than a pre-determined limit.

The recommended technique is to collapse the data set to the 5 OMB
categories using the OMB guidelines
https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards/, plus one
additional category of “2131-1 Other” to be used for unknown races,
instances where the individual declined to answer, and other races. For
each county, establish which races are below the threshold of 50 people
per county. For those races, group them into “Other”.

Please note that CCDA<sup>®</sup>[^9] allows for reporting of two or
more races. If two or more races are reported, de-identify each one as
above.

In other words, where a “more than one” race exists, the additional race
will appear in the original CDA document as a separate entry and each
entry will be de-identified using the same method. I.e., a dual race of
“Chinese” and “Polish” will be de-identified as “Asian and “White”.

#### Annual Household Income

Annual Household Income is asked for in order to assess whether the
patient qualifies for the annual poverty level. This is calculated
including the annual household size element as well. Additionally, there
is a regulatory requirement on the combined household size and income.
If the patient is “250% or below the federal poverty level”, then this
is recorded as a demographic statistic. This data is often calculated
incorrectly, so the raw data is requested as part of Family Planning
reporting in order to ensure consistent calculation.

We cannot necessarily just record a binary “at or below poverty”. There
is value to being able to establish your own meaningful income
categories that correspond to issues that we know occur in healthcare so
categories can be used here. For example, instead of $19,543 per year,
“under 20k” may be possible. The only concern here is that there is no
standard referenced value set for these categories.

In the U.S., Categories are set by the federal government every year and
cannot be established independently. The income categories in 2013 FPAR,
which are based on the HHS poverty guidelines published each year, are:
Under 101%, 101-150%, 151%-200%, 201%-250%, over 250%, unknown/not
reported

The value could possibly be substituted by a code, but this will come at
a functional cost. The most appropriate code would be reimbursement
categories.

It was decided that Annual Household Income is too difficult to
generalize to categories. If this element is too identifiable it is
possible to just submit the FPL percentage and drop both household
income and household size, and accept the costs to the data granularity.

The conclusion reached is for the reporting organization to calculate
and submit the FPL percentage in lieu of submitting Income AND Household
size.

#### Household Size

Household size as it is defined in the IHE QRPH Family Planning Profile
is data that is not identifiable, does not need to be modified and can
be passed on unchanged. However, within the U.S., the household size is
only used to calculate the FPL in conjunction with the Annual Household
Income. Therefore, for de-identification purposes, the Household size
will be calculated into FPL percentage and then deleted. See Annual
Household Income for details.

#### Visit Payer

This data element is used for performance metrics to see what percentage
of people are uninsured, are served by Medicaid, etc. Categories used
are from the payment source typology from the public health data
standards consortium archived by Public Health Information Network
(PHIN) Vocabulary Access and Distribution System (VADS):

> 1 MEDICARE2 MEDICAID5 PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE23 Medicaid/SCHIP32
> Department of Veterans Affairs38 Other Government (Federal, State,
> Local not specified)81 Self-payNA No insurance9999 Unavailable /
> Unknown

The smallest category in the U.S. currently contains 1.8 million people,
so if we use the categories listed above then this may be sufficient
generalization to not be very identifying.

The conclusion reached is to use the PHIN vocabulary described here.

#### Current Pregnancy Status

This data element is needed for performance measurement purposes to
justify why a method of contraception is not assigned. This data point
should be passed through unchanged.

Current categories in the Family Planning Profile are:

> Not Pregnant, by patient reportNot Pregnant, by test
> resultSterilizedPostmenopausalPregnant, by patient reportPregnant, by
> test result

For longitudinal measurement, this element could also be useful to count
individuals who come in as pregnant after contraception has been
assigned. However, this may not be an accurate measure. There is a risk
of pairing this element with “pregnancy intention” as a use for listing
unintended pregnancies. Similarly, connecting this with pregnancy
outcomes (if someone comes back as a subsequent visit as no longer
pregnant).

The decision made is to generalize to Yes, No or Unknown.

#### Pregnancy Intention

Pregnancy intention is used in performance measurement to evaluate the
proportion of patients that were assessed in the last year.

Pregnancy intention has a defined value set that has only four entries
and is not considered very identifiable. This field is validated and a
tested question for clinical assessment. The question that is asked is
“Would you like to become pregnant in the next year?” If the individual
is not female, this question may be asked as “Would you like to become a
parent in the next year”.

-   Yes, or Okay either way

-   No, but maybe in the future

-   No, I never want to be pregnant/have a child

-   Unsure

If the individual is not female, this question can be asked as “Would
you like to become a parent in the next year”. The answers may use the
same value set and as a result are not necessarily identifying the
individual’s gender. This data element can be passed along without
applying any de-identification algorithms.

#### Sexual Activity

This data element is used in performance measurements to establish a
correct denominator for clients who have been sexually active in the
past 3 months

The value set is limited to “yes/no/unknown” and is not considered to
provide enough detail to identify someone. This data element can be
passed along without applying any de-identification algorithms.

#### Contraceptive Method at Intake

Contraceptive method at intake is used in performance measurement to
compare “method at intake” and “method at exit” to determine if patients
gained access to more effective contraception methods during the visit.
Where there are multiple methods in use, the QRPH Family Planning
Profile instructs users to report the most effective of the methods
listed.

The value set for this data element comprises a number of methods, but
it is possible that not all are necessary for performance measurement.
The full list, however, may be useful for analytic options.

The current value list includes:

| Diaphragm or cap                       | Emergency Contraception (EC) |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Female condom                          | Female sterilization         |
| Fertility Awareness Method (FAM) FAM   | Implant                      |
| Injectables                            | IUD/IUS                      |
| Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM)LAM | Male Condom                  |
| Male relying on Female method          | None                         |
| Oral contraceptive pills               | Patch                        |
| Spermicide                             | Sponge                       |
| Vaginal Ring                           | Vasectomy                    |
| Withdrawal                             | Decline to answer            |
{:.grid}


For de-identification purposes, this data point may be passed through
unchanged.

#### Reason for No Contraceptive Method

Reason for No Contraceptive Method is used to further specify who should
be included in a given analysis. For example, don’t include people
seeking pregnancy in an analysis about why condoms are not used.
Additionally, it is useful for documenting why someone chooses to exit
an encounter without a contraceptive method. From a performance
perspective if they are not at risk of pregnancy then it is allowable
for them to exit the encounter without a method.

-   Abstinence

-   Same-sex partner

-   Seeking pregnancy

-   Declined all methods

-   Other

This data element can be passed along without applying any
de-identification algorithms. Where there is significant concern for low
probability types, “Other” should be used.

Note: For international projects, the seeking pregnancy and same-sex
partner elements may have different sensitivities and should be
evaluated independently.

#### Contraceptive Method at Exit

Please see Contraceptive Method at Intake in Section 2.7.17 for details.

To date, we are not aware of any way in which the change from method at
intake to exit can be used to identify an individual. As a result, we
conclude that this data element can be passed on unmodified, with the
categories “Highly Effective”, “Moderately Effective”, and “Less
Effective “used for low probability types.

#### Date of Last Pap test

Date of last pap test is used for a performance measure on cervical
cancer screenings, intervals between tests, etc. Time of day is not a
required level of detail and should be redacted. As compared with the
visit date however, the date of the last Pap test can be more
de-identified. Where the data set identifies Cervical Cancer Screening,
this date is to be used.

Often this data element is inaccurate when it is submitted and based on
patient recollection at the month/year level. Where accuracy is
possible, month/year may be used for research and performance
measurement purposes.

The day can be removed and the value can be generalized to week and
year.

#### HPV Co-test Ordered

HPV co-test is a date used for performance measures on HPV screenings.
This data element constitutes the date that the HPV co-test was ordered,
and is often tied to a recent visit. The data provided is often more
accurate than the date of the last pap test. However, it is used in the
same way as date of last pap test above, and can be generalized to
week/year without loss.

#### CT Screen Ordered

The CT screen is a date used for performance measures on Chlamydia
screening. This data element constitutes the date that the last
Chlamydia test was ordered, and is similar to the HPV co-test element
above and can be generalized to week/year without loss.

A potential issue with the generalization of the CT screen date to
month/year is that the data may end up with an up to 2-month variance in
the calculations for fitting within a 12-month window. This may impact
overall compliance scores. The lack of precision may negatively impact
the overall measures and their usability. This concern would not apply
with a generalization to week/year.

#### GC Screen Ordered

The GC screen is a date used for performance measures on Gonorrhea
screening. This data element constitutes the date that the last
Gonorrhea test was ordered, and is similar to the HPV co-test element
above and can be generalized to week/year without loss.

#### HIV Screen Ordered

The HIV screen is a date used for performance measures on HIV screening.
This data element constitutes the date that the last HIV test was
ordered, and is similar to the HPV co-test element above and can be
generalized to week/year without loss.

#### HIV Rapid Screen Result

The HIV Rapid Screen Result is an actual result whose value set is
Negative, Reactive, Invalid.

Test results are considered among the highest sensitivity PHI, along
with mental health information. The HIV Rapid Screen Result is collected
in order to demonstrate all the data elements necessary in order to
demonstrate all the linkage to care variables.

To demonstrate linkage to care in a U.S. setting the following
information is necessary:

-   Date the screen was performed at health provider A,

-   Results of the screening test from provider A and date results were
    received,

-   If results indicate the need for referral, the date that the
    referral was set up with health provider B and when this referral
    was communicated to the patient,

-   Date that the appropriate referral path to provider B was completed,

-   Possibly, date the completed referral path was documented by
    provider A

With this set of information, it is possible to determine the number of
days between each step in the series of events. In some cases, targets
may be established to ensure that referrals between providers are not
missed, for example, the time from when a patient knows about the need
to complete the referral visit and when that visit is completed should
be no greater than 90 days. Other examples of intervals that can delay
appropriate care may be the time it takes to receive information from a
testing laboratory or the time it takes a clinical site to notify
patients of results that require follow-up. Instead of sending actual
dates, intervals may be calculated locally and then indicator data
elements can be submitted to report the number of days between events.

The HIV related measures are highly sensitive, and the pools of patients
with data for these measures is relatively small. The preference would
be to report a flag only, or possibly separate them out from the rest of
the data

One option would be to have HIV tracking within the service site/care
organization and only disclose a yes/no on whether performance was
achieved within the 90-day period.

Another option is to have a performance measure for all non-HIV
activity, and have all HIV elements deleted. This would result in a
lower risk database to expose to the entire network. If we had a
separate database which only included the HIV data, then we could have
restricted access to only this database.

This would mean deleting the following data elements:

-   HIV Rapid Screen Result

-   HIV Supplemental Result

-   Referral Recommended Date

-   Referral Visit Completed Date

The actual numbers that need to be reported are the HIV Positivity and
Linkage to care numerator and denominators described here:
<https://blog.aids.gov/2012/08/secretary-sebelius-approves-indicators-for-monitoring-hhs-funded-hiv-services.html>

Concerns with the approach of removing the HIV related data elements is
that additional research on HIV will not be possible. In the U.S., a
separate summary report may be necessary to allow service sites to
report aggregate performance goals for HIV Positivity and Linkage to
Care, instead of at the individual level. Until that separate mechanism
is established, for de-identification purposes the HIV data should be
deleted.

#### HIV Supplemental Result

-   This data element is to be deleted from the de-identified data set.

#### Referral Recommended Date and Referral Visit Completed Date 

For performance measurement purposes, the referral recommended date and
referral visit completed date are used to identify if visits like
smoking cessation, weight management, etc. are being met. For the
purposes of de-identification, all HIV Referral recommended dates and
Referral completed dates shall be redacted, but other dates can be
forwarded.

Note: The Referral Recommended and Referral Visit Completed date for
performance measurement of other chronic diseases can be challenging to
capture, however from a privacy and security perspective do not pose a
significant additional de-identification risk. The proposal is that if
these data elements are collected, then:

-   Remove HIV referral dates

-   Generalize dates to week/month/year or month/year, if possible, for
    non-HIV referral dates

#### Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure

The Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure data elements are used in
performance measurement for blood pressure screening goals for male
clients as a significant contributor in fertility assessment, as well as
for pregnant female clients.

These data elements are not considered to be highly sensitive and may be
considered as just data rather than indirect or direct identifiers and
do not require de-identification. As such, these values should be passed
through unchanged.

#### Height and Weight

Height and weight are used in performance measurement of BMI. Weight may
also be useful for measurement of effectiveness of contraception in
patients over 175lbs/79kg. Additionally, there are multiple methods for
calculation of BMI.

While the data set discussed here should not be used for research,
performance metrics on contraception prescription given certain
population characteristics could be really useful. This data could also
be used to facilitate quality improvement programs in reproductive
health and primary care settings.

As a result, it is desirable to have both the height and weight values
and not attempt to calculate and submit only the BMI.

Upper and lower bounds of height and weight may be more than just data,
whereas values within normal boundaries can be considered benign in
terms of identifiability. For values outside of maximum or minimum
values, report at the limit value.

We propose that height and weight be edited when they are above or below
certain maximum or minimum values. For values outside of the acceptable
range, they shall be reported at the limit value rather than the
specific height or weight value.

For height, pass through unchanged, except for values below 59 inches or
above 76 inches. For values below 59 inches, convert to 59 inches. For
values above 76 inches, convert to 76 inches.

For weight, pass through unchanged, except for values below 100 lbs. or
above 299 lbs. For values below 100 lbs., convert to 100 lbs. For values
above 299 lbs., convert to 299 lbs.

Upper and lower limits for height and weight are based on the NHIS
survey:
ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/NHIS/2010/samadult_freq.pdf

#### Smoking status

Smoking status is used for performance measurement purposes to report
that clinicians are assessing the smoking status of patients in family
planning.

In the U.S., Smoking status is encoded as per the Meaningful Use data
set:

| Current every day smoker       | 449868002       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Current some day smoker        | 428041000124106 |
| Former smoker                  | 8517006         |
| Never smoker                   | 266919005       |
| Smoker, current status unknown | 77176002        |
| Unknown if ever smoked         | 266927001       |
| Heavy tobacco smoker           | 428071000124103 |
| Light tobacco smoker           | 428061000124105 |
{:.grid}


The Meaningful Use value set represents a certain degree of fuzzing, as
clinical providers may be documenting more detail on smoking status but
are only required to record as per the above categories.

This identifier is considered to not significantly contribute to
identification of an individual.

### Appendix A: Sample FP CDA documents and their De-Identified documents

#### A.1 Patient: JB

JB is a 16-year-old G-0 P-0 in the clinic for STI screening and well
woman exam. Last menstrual period (LMP) was 3 weeks ago. No history of
STI. BP: 110/75. Height: 157.5 cm. Weight: 58 kg. Intermittent condom
use. Last unprotected sex was 2 weeks ago after which she used oral
emergency contraception. Since JB’s condom use is only intermittent and
emergency contraception is not an effective method, her method at intake
is listed as “none”. Wants to have children “at some point, but no time
soon”. Wants to use pills for contraception going forward. Non-smoker.
Rapid HIV test is negative. Post visit, chlamydia results are positive
and gonorrhea results are negative. No insurance can be billed at the
time of the visit. Demographics: White, native U.S. English speaker.
Since 16 year olds seldom know their family income, JB’s FPL is
calculated based on her own $5000 income from a part-time job, and her
household size of 1. White, native U.S. English speaker. JB’s household
size is 3, and her family’s annual income is $9000 therefore the Income
for JB is approximately 44% of the Federal Poverty Level (see ASPE here:

#### A.5 Sample of Multi-Stage CDA De-Identification (Based on Patient JB)

This section demonstrates the multi-stage de-identification process for a Family Planning CDA document, using the scenario of Patient JB (see A.1). Three versions are shown:

1. **Original CDA** (identified)
2. **Stage 1: Pseudonymized CDA** (direct identifiers replaced, reversible pseudonyms)
3. **Stage 2: Anonymized CDA** (irreversible pseudonyms, generalization, suppression)

**Original CDA**

#### A.1 Patient: JB

JB is a 16-year-old G-0 P-0 in the clinic for STI screening and well
woman exam. Last menstrual period (LMP) was 3 weeks ago. No history of
STI. BP: 110/75. Height: 157.5 cm. Weight: 58 kg. Intermittent condom
use. Last unprotected sex was 2 weeks ago after which she used oral
emergency contraception. Since JB’s condom use is only intermittent and
emergency contraception is not an effective method, her method at intake
is listed as “none”. Wants to have children “at some point, but no time
soon”. Wants to use pills for contraception going forward. Non-smoker.
Rapid HIV test is negative. Post visit, chlamydia results are positive
and gonorrhea results are negative. No insurance can be billed at the
time of the visit. Demographics: White, native U.S. English speaker.
Since 16 year olds seldom know their family income, JB’s FPL is
calculated based on her own $5000 income from a part-time job, and her
household size of 1. White, native U.S. English speaker. JB’s household
size is 3, and her family’s annual income is $9000 therefore the Income
for JB is approximately 44% of the Federal Poverty Level (see ASPE here:
<http://aspe.hhs.gov/2015-poverty-guidelines#guidelines>).

### Appendix B: Usability

Analysis of de-Identified data

Based on the initial set of de-identification techniques, and an
analysis of the sample de-identified Family Planning reports listed in
Section X.2 using those techniques, the following concerns have been
raised with regards to the usability of the de-Identified data for
performance measurement purposes:

1.  Not having HIV positivity rates is a problem for HHS, and removal of
    HIV rapid screen result is an issue

14. Setting age group for Chlamydia screening to “People under 18” is
    problematic because we will lose our trends for under 15, and 15-17
    year olds. These trends and measures are important for tracking
    beyond just the Chlamydia screening.

Historically, these trends have been tracked by the Title X grantees
based on identified data, and submitted to HHS as an aggregate report.

There are three alternatives to balancing the usability issue and the
risk of re-identification due to the small size of the under 15 pool of
individuals. OPA should select from the following three alternatives:

1.  Continue to manage this trend reporting as a separate reporting
    stream so that the data submitted to the FPAR 2.0 database

2.  Perform an independent de-identification analysis, so that the
    separate database can remove many other data elements and have
    separate pseudonyms while keeping the more granular age

3.  Restrict the overall access to the FPAR 2.0 database so that the
    much more sensitive data is safeguarded better

15. Using single age instead of date of birth will affect the
    calculation (numerator/denominator inclusion/exclusions) of
    age-dependent performance measures. If M/D/Y is not an option, then
    W/Y or M/Y (assume birthdate on 15<sup>th</sup> day) will increase
    measure accuracy and comparability. Analysts will have discretion on
    the assumptions they make and the cases they include/exclude. The
    use of different assumptions about which cases to include/exclude
    will be a limitation in cross-clinic, cross-subrecipient,
    cross-grantee, etc., comparisons. If a female client turns 21 two
    days or even a month after the visit, but the provider decides to do
    the pap test early to eliminate the need for a repeat visit, then
    the proposed specification will make it appear as if the provider
    did not follow recommended guidelines. An age specification that is
    less blunt will allow the analyst to include cases for some weeks or
    days before or after the visit date.

There is a method used to calculate age and year to use a decimal to
demonstrate if someone is 18 or 18.25 or 18.5 — or month and year.

This can be an example of a missed opportunity, where the provider
missed an opportunity to order a screening before the patient’s
21<sup>st</sup> birthday.

We need to answer the question of how many non-compliants would we
discover if we had more granular birthdate/age information. The business
concern is how accurate would our data be if we don’t have this
granularity.

18.25, 18.5 and 18.75 would be enough to add to the usefulness of the
data. This way the analyst could choose whether to include 18.75 in the
numerator/denominator. Does this impose too much on the reporting
agencies? Does this expand the size of the data that will be transmitted
and calculated?

If we don’t provide people with the actual date of birth, data analysts
will start making choices on how to compare grantee compliance etc. In
that case, we would need to provide guidance on how to use the less
granular data as a performance monitoring tool.

For age granularity as with the previous item, the options are something
that OPA will need to determine. i.e.:

-   Submit separate aggregate report

-   Maintain a separate database

-   Accept the higher risk to the FPAR 2.0 database for all use cases
    and restrict access to it/add safeguards

16. STI Screen Order questions(1) Using the “screen order” date instead
    of a “test performed” date may overstate CT, GC and HIV testing if a
    test is ordered but a specimen is not collected/tested. This
    situation may occur if the specimen is collected at a different
    location or if the client is asked to return on/at a different
    day/time. Is there a way to ensure that a test is not counted unless
    the record also contains a result? Just a thought. (2) Reducing the
    date to M/Y will affect calculation of performance measures related
    to timely treatment (measured in days). While I recommend M/D/Y for
    screen order dates, a W/Y specification would get us closer to a
    more accurate measure calculation.

Time of order and time of screen are less identifying than age. A
statistical analysis on a representative sample of data is needed in
order to determine if W/Y is still sufficiently large as to not be an
issue.

17. Last Cervical Cancer Screen questionsW/Y date is preferable to M/Y
    to allow for more accurate calculation of Pap test performance
    measures.Last Cervical Cancer Screen:W/Y date is preferable to M/Y
    to allow for more accurate calculation of Pap test performance
    measures.Since order date is less identifying than age, a
    statistical analysis on a representative sample of data is needed in
    order to determine if W/Y is still sufficiently large as to not be
    an issue.

#### B.1 Threat cases for re-identification of family planning data:

A quick Google search on the term re-identification will yield many
blogs, papers and studies describing where de-identified datasets were
combined with publicly available databases in order to re-identify
individuals. Most experts in this field agree that re-identification is
not easy, but with sufficient resources and motivation, a poorly
de-identified data set may be re-identifiable.

One such example is the study described in the well-known paper
*Identifying Participants in the Personal Genome Project by
Name*[^10]*,* by Latanya Sweeney, Akua Abu, and Julia Win*,* where they
were able to re-identify individuals by comparing certain genomic
markers against public information about their demographics. The paper
concludes that some individuals can be identified using as little
information as their date of birth, gender, and 5-digit zip code.

In the section below we follow best practices and explore the most
likely sources of threats to the Family Planning de-identified data set
in order to ensure that we have considered whether the de-identification
techniques selected address such issues as the very high risk of
including date of birth and gender in a data set.

##### B.1.1 Threat motivators and threat agents:

The following are potential motivators and actors who may want to
identify certain types of individuals from the de-identified data. As
shown below, we are not concerned with clinical providers using
identified data for inappropriate purposes.

1.  Targeting of people who have consumed family planning services of
    any kind (media, religious groups)

18. Targeting of people who have had or considered abortions (law
    enforcement, relatives, religious groups/religious police/religious
    authorities)

19. Targeting of facilities and individual providers of family planning
    services (religious groups, relatives, hate based organizations)

20. Underage contraception or sexual activity (parents, family/clan,
    religious groups/religious police/religious authorities)

21. Discovery of sexual activity of relatives or employees (parents,
    family/clan, religious groups/religious police/religious
    authorities, employers)

22. Identification of vulnerable candidates for child abuse/prostitution
    (organized crime activity by corrupt community and local government
    authorities)

23. Transsexual or homosexual targeting (law enforcement, parents,
    family/clan, religious or political groups/religious
    police/religious or political authorities, employers)

24. Discovering STDs and HIV status of friends, relatives or target
    groups or employers

25. Illegal discrimination for work purposes (e.g., if someone is
    pregnant, trans, etc.)

26. Theft of medical identity

27. Theft of medical services

28. Insurance fraud

29. Use of family planning data as ancillary data to other big data
    analysis to see what correlates (e.g., correlation with schedules
    and other data for insurance or tax fraud)

30. Provider contract fraud (falsify data to get a better rating –
    create a bunch of fake patients that we never actually saw that you
    can’t tell are not patients because they are de-identified)

##### B.1.2 Analysis of Threat cases

The following is an analysis of how the currently de-identified data
could be combined and attacked in the context of the threat cases listed
above. Please note that motivated attackers are often armed with
information such as unexplained absences of a minor who was late coming
home from school: a relative who suspects that this individual had an
encounter with a family planning clinic could use the unexplained
absence date as a visit date to narrow down the de-Identified data set.
Armed with the visit date, knowledge of their relative’s age, and
potentially the region or location of the clinic they suspect was
visited can narrow down the pool of information significantly.

The analysis contained in this section is still performed at a
theoretical level and can at best recommend risky data combinations to
look for in a real data set. A statistical analysis of a representative
data set is still needed in order to determine where these risks are
likely enough that additional de-identification, or application of
access control and other security restrictions are necessary.

1.  It is feasible that motivated individuals who want to target or
    embarrass people who have consumed family planning services in
    general could compare the de-identified family planning database
    with other publicly available databases in order to see how many
    individuals can be identified. An excellent analysis of such an
    attack on de-identified published Netflix ratings to identify
    individual Netflix users is discussed in this paper:
    <https://digital.lib.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/417/vol5_no1_art3.pdf?sequence=1>

31. In order to identify people who have considered abortions, the
    following four data elements could be used to identify a pregnancy
    that may have been aborted:

-   Pregnancy intention

-   Sexual activity

-   Pregnancy status

-   Visit date

-   Contraceptive method (at intake or at exit)

A motivated attacker could reduce the data set by using the above
combinations, and then combining it with other databases or information
to identify who the individuals might be.

In other words, someone with a pregnancy intention of no, with a sexual
activity of yes, and a pregnancy status of Yes on a visit date in March
2015, and then a pregnancy status of No in April of 2015 could be
targeted as potential recipients of abortive services.

Since pregnancy history is no longer being collected, the risk of
identifying someone in this category is significantly reduced.

Additionally, the contraceptive method (at exit) of Emergency
Contraception could result in targeting of an individual for the same
reasons as abortion. When the statistical analysis is performed, if the
pool of people contains any identifiable individuals, ECP as a
contraceptive method should be considered as a risk and should be
further de-identified by creating category called “other effective
method” and reporting people using ECP as “other”. However, this is an
issue for performance measurement since the availability of these
methods is an important measure of availability and quality of care.

Alternatively, list the “method at exit” as something that the
individual will be using after the ECP, such as condoms, etc.

Conclusion: There is still a significant amount of risk related to this
threat case. These data are still potentially PHI. The only way to
determine whether the data included in this set is still identifiable is
to apply the techniques to a representative data set and perform a
statistical analysis following one of the accepted statistical models.

32. Underage contraception or sexual activity:

-   Age

If the grouping of individuals listed as “under 18” is small, then the
individuals could be highly identifiable.

-   It is worth noting that given a large enough longitudinal sample it
    will become possible to identify the birth month and year of a given
    individual when their age increments.

-   Age categories or a fuzzing technique could help reduce this risk,
    as well as infrequent submission of documents to the FPAR 2.0
    repository – i.e., perform reporting on an annual or less frequent
    basis (Even though the FPAR 2.0 CDA documents may be submitted
    automatically as soon as they are generated, actual **reporting** on
    those documents is currently only required to be annual. This
    greatly reduces this risk, although reports can be submitted more
    often if service sites want to check where they are)**.** Another
    strategy would be to release single-year data sets with collapsed
    categories and multi-year data sets with more cases and more
    granular categories. With more cases in every category the risk
    declines.

-   Very low height and weight could also be used to reduce the size of
    the population in the pool and identify an individual

-   Pregnancy status could also further shrink the pool

**\*May want to say that you only need longitudinal consistency within a
reporting year. In that case, the pseudonym tables for the patient ID
should be flushed/re-anonymized once a year.**

This may make the data less useful, and make it impossible to compare
progress at the patient level over the course of many years. The longer
data is kept, the more identifiable the individual becomes and this
identifiability must be balanced with the data and measurement needs.

33. Discovery of sexual activity of relatives or employees:

-   Individuals from strict religious environments who would want to
    search for their relative based on a suspected visit date and known
    demographics to find out if the answer to the “Sexual Activity”
    question is Yes

Analysis: the technique used to de-identify the patient or provider ID
must be strong enough for relatives to not be able to identify an
individual’s new ID. (this is true for all attacks)

34. For the threat case of identification of vulnerable candidates for
    child abuse/prostitution, aside from the data combinations already
    listed above, there is not much else in the de-identified data set
    that could be used for this purpose.

-   Since pregnancy history or unusually early contraceptive use is
    already redacted

-   Age (attending a clinic and being in a certain young age group may
    be enough to result in targeting)

The probability of this threat occurring is low with the “18 and under”
generalization. If we move to “15 and under” and “15-17”, this threat
case may become more of a concern.

In 2013 for all FP users there were over 300k in the 15-17, and under 15
was 38k in 2013 and 45k in 2014. Under 15 females for 2014 there were
36, 626 individuals in the category. Broken out by region if the
facility ID is re-identifiable, this may become a very small pool.

35. Transsexual or homosexual targeting

-   Administrative sex – transsexual entries have been redacted, and
    submitters have been notified to either “pick one” or “don’t submit
    those patients”. This is effective for reducing identification of
    transsexual patients in the data set.

-   Reason for no contraceptive method – “same-sex partner” has been
    left in as an option. Depending on the data set, this may become
    identifying of a limited set of vulnerable individuals.

-   Threat analysis: Law enforcement or family/clan who work for the
    system may have access to these data. In that case they could
    combine reason for no contraceptive method with visit dates, ages,
    height/weight, facility identifier to identify a homosexual
    individual.

-   **Is this a risk in some areas? Should we further de-identify this
    by lumping same-sex partner in as “other”?**

36. Discovering STDs and HIV status of friends, relatives or target
    groups or employers

-   Since HIV information except for week/year of initial HIV screening
    has been redacted/put off into a separate report, this is fairly
    unidentifiable. If this information were to be included, it would
    contain a lot of identifying information for a vulnerable
    individual.

-   For other STDs such as HPV, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, since we
    generalized the test dates to week and year and the only information
    included is the test date, this is fairly un-identifying of
    sensitive data.

37. Illegal discrimination for work purposes (e.g., if someone is
    pregnant, trans, etc.)

-   Employers who are motivated to discriminate against homosexual or
    pregnant potential hires who would use publicly available
    demographics, regional and race/ethnicity to identify an individual
    and verify whether their “reason for no contraceptive method” is
    seeking pregnancy or same-sex partner

Analysis: If an employer wants to covertly not hire someone who has
same-sex partners or is actively seeking pregnancy, they could use the
above data set to create a list of “undesirable” individuals, but would
need to still identify if the potential hire is part of this list. It is
unlikely that the pool of candidates will be small enough for this to be
identifiable. A family planning database may not be worth the effort in
this scenario.

38. Theft of medical identity

-   A motivated individual who does not have health insurance or who
    otherwise wants to steal a patient’s medical identity in order to
    pose as that patient could mine the overall family planning database
    and compare it with publicly identifiable data to see if anyone in
    the database can be successfully re-identified along with their
    insurance information or other information.

Analysis: While the risk for identifying an individual when mining the
overall database is yet to be determined based on statistical analysis
of a representative data set, this particular threat case does not pose
significant risk since there is not enough information in the family
planning data to motivate someone who wants to steal a medical identity.
Clinical studies and other health related databases would be more likely
targets.

39. Theft of medical services

-   Thief has a motivation to conceal a theft of services by damaging
    the information used to detect theft. In other words, this is a risk
    to the data set, but not necessarily to identifiability. This is not
    something that can be solved with de-identification, but should be
    considered as part of the implementation of policy and procedures as
    well as technical safeguards for the FPAR 2.0 data

40. Insurance fraud

-   Thief who is likely an insider has a motivation to conceal a theft
    of services by damaging the information used to detect theft. In
    other words, this is a risk to the data set, but not necessarily to
    identifiability. This is not something that can be solved with
    de-identification, but should be considered as part of the
    implementation of policy and procedures as well as technical
    safeguards for the FPAR 2.0 data

41. Use of family planning data as ancillary data to other big data
    analysis to see what correlates (e.g., correlation with schedules
    and other data for insurance or tax fraud)

-   When ancillary data is available, indirect identifiers can be used
    to compare with other available databases to identify patients.

42. Provider contract fraud: not a risk for re-identification, this is
    more of a risk to the quality of the data. The way to avoid this
    risk is to ensure that any value or financial decisions are made
    based on the identified data set.

Other approach: if you take the table that we have and eliminate the
identifiers that we’ve deleted and the items that we have said are just
data, you have the focused list of indirect identifiers and techniques –
what correlations are obvious there?

#### B.2 Theoretical K-analysis:

Until a data set is available, it is helpful to identify combinations of
data elements that could be identifying. Once data is available, these
combinations can be tested against that data set to see if a pool of
individuals small enough to be identifying would result.

The first step is to look at the table containing our original
assessment of whether the data element is direct/indirect/data and
assess whether the de-identified element is now direct/indirect/data.

##### B.2.1 Indirect identifier analysis

For identifiers that are still indirect after de-identification, we need
to look at two factors for each indirect identifier:

1.  What is the smallest percentage of the pool that the indirect
    identifiers could result in?

43. Which indirect identifiers can be combined to identify small pools
    of individuals.

Total number of people in the set (except where otherwise identified) =

Theoretical “bench” analysis: In the absence of other information, we
are going to take a cross-product of all the smallest pools and identify
the number of people in that pool.

We suspect that the smallest grouping will be caused by the two small
race categories, and the date of birth/age category.

**Formula** = smallest pool \#/total for that category x smallest pool
\#/total for that category…

**Total number of users** = 4,129,283 people who have received Title X
services

In order: start from the largest group first / sort them in order
descending, and note the intermediate results. Note when the pool drops
to less than 20 people. (i.e., k=20)

For example, smallest pool within the Ethnicity category = 1,237,652
Hispanic or Latino people = .299746

LEP YES = 522,294/4,129,283 = .126651

Ethnicity x LEP YES = .03796328 = 156,750 people (still okay!)

CT screen = .499053

Ethnicity x LEP YES x CT = 0. = 78,260

GC =

HIV =

Age (with under 18s grouped together) =

Race: Since two of the race categories are so small, we need to figure
out a way to reduce the risk for that data element. One option is to
group those together, and possibly mix both of those into another
category. (Currently categories are: 1002-5 American Indian or Alaska
Native 2028-9 Asian 2054-5 Black or African American 2076-8 Native
Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 2106-3 White). Is it possible to
group Hawaiians/Alaskans in with Asians? Is this still useful for
reporting needs? There are three options:

-   Further combine the smaller groups into larger categories

-   Separate reporting to OPA (out of scope for this supplement)

-   Separate de-ID stream/database

Additionally, if Family Planning data will continue to be mapped to
regions (based on grouped facility IDs), then the pool for
low-occurrence races and ethnicities becomes even smaller, and therefore
higher risk. In other words, a Native Hawaiian will be very common and
therefore low-risk for re-identification in the state of Hawaii but less
so in Alaska, and vice versa.

Based on the bench analysis, the three data elements that are high risk
are Race, FPL and Age. For these data elements, what information is
really necessary? What information do we need to bring to decision
makers to decide what to do? Do we split data streams? Do we accept
separate reporting? Etc. Do we redact anyone who fits into the small
pool categories? Do we accept the risk?

What if the expense and risk to the data integrity is too high, can we
make the database private? I.e., people can request reports, but not
access it directly? This imposes a burden on whoever is managing the
database to manage the RBAC or other protections to that database. Is
there a way to create a “lighter” database that doesn’t include the
risky elements that is more widely available (where race is collapsed to
black/white/other) and age is grouped into broader categories, and
access to the more specific categories is tightly managed?

Conclusion: Data is not sufficiently de-identified to be low risk and
accessible to all grantees and service sites. Other protection methods
need to be considered based on what is cost-effective. Access to even
the de-identified data set should be limited as strictly as possible and
other methods of providing data to the community must be considered,
such as:

-   pre-planned, aggregate dashboards to provide significant data to the
    community via a public portal

-   data-upon-request, provision of deeper statistical data snapshots to
    individual grantees, sub-recipients, and researchers via research
    request which is performed by a limited number of OPA-trusted staff
    with enhanced privacy and security training.

## Implementation and Governance

This section addresses the implementation, validation, and governance aspects of the FPAR de-identification process per the [Process](process.html) framework.

### Implementation Approach

**Software Implementation**: The de-identification techniques specified in this analysis can be implemented using:
-   Established de-identification tools configured for FPAR requirements
-   Custom software developed following the IHE QRPH De-Identification for Family Planning supplement specifications
-   Standard software development methodologies with privacy-by-design principles

**Technology Stack Considerations**:
-   XML/CDA parsing capabilities for input processing
-   Cryptographic libraries for secure hashing (SHA-512 or equivalent)
-   Statistical analysis tools for k-anonymity validation
-   Secure data transfer mechanisms (SFTP, HTTPS)
-   Encrypted storage (AES-256 or equivalent)

### Validation Requirements

**Design Validation** (Pre-Implementation):
1.  Review element-by-element technique selections with privacy experts and clinical stakeholders
2.  Create prototype de-identified dataset using sample data
3.  Validate prototype against FPAR reporting requirements with end-users
4.  Conduct risk assessment on prototype data to confirm k-anonymity targets achieved
5.  IRB or Privacy Board review as required by organizational policies

**Implementation Validation** (Operational Testing):
1.  Test with subset of real operational data
2.  Verify all CDA elements processed correctly
3.  Confirm cryptographic operations produce expected pseudonyms with consistency
4.  Validate k-anonymity analysis on test output
5.  Confirm CSV output format meets recipient system requirements
6.  Verify no direct identifiers remain in output

**Ongoing Monitoring**:
-   Periodic re-assessment of re-identification risk (annually or when threats evolve)
-   Audit logs of de-identification processing
-   Review of data recipient access patterns
-   Incident response for any suspected privacy breaches

### Governance Framework

**Role Responsibilities**:

-   **Policy Manager Team**: OPA privacy officials, legal counsel, IT security - establish de-identification policies and standards
-   **Executor Team**: Dedicated de-identification intermediary staff - perform the transformation process
-   **Supervisor/Auditor**: Privacy Officer or designated authority - audit compliance, review incident reports

**Access Control and Security Policies**:

-   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Personnel access only data necessary for their roles
-   **Secrets Management**: Cryptographic salts, hash keys stored in secure vault with strict access controls
-   **Secure Data Transfer**: All data transfers encrypted in transit (SFTP/HTTPS)
-   **Data Encryption at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all datasets at rest
-   **Secure Data Disposal**: DOD-level secure wipe for media containing identifiable data before decommissioning

**Data Use Agreements**:
-   All Title X recipients must sign data use agreements prohibiting re-identification attempts
-   Agreements specify permitted uses aligned with FPAR reporting purposes
-   Contractual penalties for misuse
-   Regular training for recipients on data handling obligations

**Documentation and Record Keeping**:
-   Service request and use case documentation
-   Complete re-identification risk assessment reports
-   Element-by-element technique specification (this document)
-   Configuration parameters and transformation scripts
-   Records of all data transfers and access
-   Validation and approval reports
-   Audit logs with minimum 3-year retention

**Incident Management**:
-   Follow organizational security incident response policy
-   Immediate reporting of suspected or actual privacy breaches
-   Containment procedures for unauthorized data access
-   Post-incident review and corrective action processes

### Continuous Improvement

**Periodic Review Triggers**:
-   Annual scheduled review of de-identification approach
-   New re-identification attack methodologies published in literature
-   Changes to public data availability (e.g., new census releases)
-   Technology advances affecting computational re-identification costs
-   Regulatory or policy changes affecting privacy requirements
-   Changes to FPAR reporting requirements necessitating data element modifications

**Threat Evolution Examples**:
-   Sweeney's ZIP+DOB+Sex analysis (historical but foundational)
-   Advances in genetic re-identification techniques
-   Commercial availability of consumer databases for linkage
-   Machine learning advances in pattern recognition
-   Mobile phone location tracking enabling healthcare facility visit correlation

The de-identification landscape is dynamic. What is considered sufficient protection today may become inadequate as technology and available data evolve. The governance framework must include mechanisms for regular reassessment and adaptation.

### Integration with IHE QRPH Supplement

This analysis document provides the rationale and framework for the technical specifications in the IHE QRPH De-Identification for Family Planning Trial Implementation Supplement. Implementers should:

1.  Use the IHE QRPH supplement for precise technical specifications (CDA templates, value sets, transformation rules)
2.  Refer to this document for understanding the "why" behind each technique selection
3.  Apply the [Process](process.html) framework when adapting this approach for different contexts or jurisdictions
4.  Consult the [Techniques](algorithms.html), [Data Types](data-types.html), and [Concepts](concepts.html) chapters for foundational de-identification knowledge

### Conclusion

The Family Planning de-identification analysis demonstrates a comprehensive, systematic approach to privacy-preserving data sharing for public health reporting. By following the structured process framework - from context analysis through risk assessment to element-by-element mitigation design - the FPAR use case achieves the target identifiability level (Irreversibly Pseudonymized Data) while maintaining analytical utility for program evaluation and policy decisions.

This implementation guide serves as both a specification for the Title X FPAR use case and a template demonstrating how to apply the IHE De-Identification Handbook methodology to other health data secondary use scenarios.
